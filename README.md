## Default Template

This app/repo is the default template for new projects in [Joystick](https://cheatcode.co/joystick).

The template features:

- A structure that aligns with Joystick's file structure.
- An example of creating UI components.
- An example of creating and calling API endpoints.
- An example of defining and connecting to a WebSocket server.
- Example tests written using Joystick's built-in testing framework.

This template is intended to be a barebones starting point for building an app with Joystick.

## Documentation

To start building, [head over to the Joystick docs](https://docs.cheatcode.co/joystick) and read up on its full feature set.
